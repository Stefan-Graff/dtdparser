Version 1.19
============

Changed expansion of entities to take the first definition of the entity
instead of the most recent (required by XML specification)

Modified scanner to parse identifiers and nmtokens correctly - allowed
identifiers to begin with : or _.

Fixed parsing of #PCDATA to conform to XML specification. If #PCDATA appears
by itself (i.e. (#PCDATA) ), don't allow * after it. If #PCDATA appears at
the beginning of a list (i.e. (#PCDATA|foo|bar|baz) ), require '*' to
follow it.
